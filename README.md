Work related to the unit: CCE3013 - Computer Architecture

Assignment 1 contains the source code for a serial impelementation of a Block Matching Algorithm using a Three-Step Serach, as well as a report related to this work.

Assignment 2 contains:
* An optimised version of the serial implementaion of Assignment 1
* A parallelised verision of the same algorithm using CUDA-Implementation-of-Block-Matching-Algorithm-Using-Three-Step-Search
* An optimised, parallelised version of the algorithm

as well as a report corresponding to this work.
